## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, jQuery

Using HTML, CSS and jQuery, I created this application where you can choose how many dice you'd like to roll, how many sides they each have and how many dice you want to omit from the roll. The results will then display in list form.

## Optimizations

This app works without issues.

## Lessons Learned:

As simple as it seems, it was difficult to at times to implement multiple funcions for the same element, but I learned a lot.
